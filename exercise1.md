The steps one would need for a Rust CI/CD pipeline include pulling in dependencies(cargo), linting(clippy), and compiling(rustc).
Open source alternatives to Jenkins and GH Actions include CircleCI and goCD.
Since Rust must be compiled, if the size of the application becomes large, it could become expensive to run CI/CD on a cloud-hosted platform.
